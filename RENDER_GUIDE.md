# Deploying PicklePro to Render

This guide will help you deploy the **PicklePro** application (Backend + Frontend) to Render using the `render.yaml` Blueprint.

## Prerequisites

1.  A [GitHub account](https://github.com/) with this repository pushed.
2.  A [Render account](https://render.com/).
3.  A **MongoDB Atlas** database URI.
4.  A **Google OAuth Client ID** (for login).

## Step 1: Create a New Blueprint on Render

1.  Log in to your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2.  Click on the **"New +"** button and select **"Blueprint"**.
3.  Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already.
4.  Select the `picklepro` repository from the list.

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Render will detect the `render.yaml` file and ask you to provide values for the environment variables defined in it.

You will see a form asking for the following:

*   **SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI**: Paste your MongoDB Atlas connection string here.
    *   Example: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/picklepro?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
*   **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: Paste your Google OAuth Client ID.
*   **ADMIN_EMAILS**: Comma-separated list of email addresses that should have admin access.
    *   Example: `jayy2kok@gmail.com`

**Note:** `JWT_SECRET` will be automatically generated by Render.

## Step 3: Apply and Deploy

1.  Click **"Apply"**.
2.  Render will verify the configuration and start deploying both the **Backend** and **Frontend** services.
3.  You can monitor the deployment progress in the dashboard.
4.  Once the deployment is complete, you will see green checkmarks next to your services.

## Accessing Your App

*   Click on the **picklepro-ui** service in your dashboard.
*   Click the URL provided (e.g., `https://picklepro-ui.onrender.com`).
*   Your app is now live!
